# API Test Design

**A simple [portfolio project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/185gLT4z4gHil4tuixmC8cn_mCF9tu-I1GYQwhCYO9xU/edit?usp=sharing) showing how I design and document API tests &nbsp;🌼**

---

## Task description

**🌿 Objective** 

Design API test cases for the following endpoints:

1. **POST** `https://gorest.co.in/public-api/users` - create a new user  
2. **GET** `https://gorest.co.in/public-api/users/{id}` - retrieve user details by ID

<br>

**🌿 Approach**

- asked clarifying questions to fully understand the endpoints and avoid gaps in coverage
- designed test cases to cover expected functionality, edge cases, and potential errors
- focused on clarity, completeness, and maintainability

---

## Skills demonstrated

- API test case design
- coverage analysis for happy path and edge cases  
- clear and maintainable documentation
